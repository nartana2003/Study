#Steps of clustering
1. Develop semi-optimal or random clusters
2. Improve the cluster in each iteration
3. Iterate as many times as needed
4. Show the optimal way of clustering objects

-First, the objects in a cluster should be very similar
-Second, the objects in each cluster should be very
dissimilar to the objects in other clusters.

1.K-mean clustering

2.Hierarchicial clustering-Agglomerative and Divisive clustering

Evaluation of clustering 
1.Clustering tendency- determining if a given dataset has a non-random structure which would lead to meaningful clusters.  
2.Measuring cluster quality-Silhouette coefficient

Silhouette coefficient = b(o)-a(o)/max{a(o),b(o)}
We want it to be high.This score is usually between 0 and 1. The closer it is to 1 the better the score and the closer it is to 0 the worse
the score.

Cluster variation should be low.
